🔎 Palindrome CheckerA fun and simple web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that determines if a given input text is a palindrome.The application adheres strictly to the definition of a palindrome by ignoring all punctuation, spacing, and case differences during the check.✨ FeaturesCase and Punctuation Agnostic: The core logic cleans the input by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting everything to lowercase before comparison.Intuitive UI: A clean, modern interface styled with CSS, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.Client-Side Logic: Fast, instant checking with all logic running directly in the browser.Informative Alert: Prompts the user with an alert if they attempt to check an empty input.🛠️ Technology StackTechnologyRoleHTML5Provides the structure, including the input field, button, and result display area.CSS3Styles the page with a clean card layout, shadows, and responsive element sizing.JavaScriptContains the core palindrome logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.🧠 Palindrome Logic ExplainedThe core of the palindrome check is handled by this line of JavaScript, which ensures accuracy for phrases like "A man, a plan, a canal. Panama":JavaScriptconst replaced = textInput.value.replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/g, "").toLowerCase();
Cleaning the Input (.replace()):The Regular Expression /[^A-Za-z0-9]/g is used to find and remove any character that is NOT an uppercase letter (A-Z), a lowercase letter (a-z), or a digit (0-9).Example: "My age is 0, 0 si ega ym." becomes "Myageis00siega ym".Case Normalization (.toLowerCase()):The cleaned string is immediately converted to lowercase to ensure case doesn't cause a false negative.Example: "Myageis00siega ym" becomes "myageis00siega ym".Reversal and Comparison:The cleaned and lowered string (replaced) is converted to an array ([...replaced]), reversed, and then joined back into a string.The original replaced string is then compared directly to its reversed version (reversed). If they match, the input is a palindrome.⚙️ Installation and SetupSince this is a client-side project, deployment is simple.Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone [Your Repository URL Here]
